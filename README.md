Card games pose an attractive opportunity for per-
forming experimentation, along with uncertainties and the partial
observability of the game with reinforcement learning.This ap-
proach aims to discover the most effective strategies for winning
consistently in the specific card game of Blackjack.So its obvious
that people playing these games involving money would like to
explore new strategies to increase winnings or minimize losses.
This paper explores model-free methods such as Q Learning
and SARSA[1], seeking the optimal policy for playing Blackjack
against a dealer.It tries to find the policies, which indicate the
best action based on the player’s score and the dealer’s visible
card. The observed policy aligns with the fact how players with
advanced techniques apply specific strategies in their games.
